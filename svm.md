# Support Vector Machines

Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a powerful machine learning algorithm widely employed in classification tasks.

Support Vector Machines operate on the principle of finding the optimal hyperplane that maximally separates data points of different classes. The term "support vectors" refers to the data points that are critical in determining the position and orientation of the hyperplane. In SVM, the algorithm seeks to find a hyperplane that best separates the data points of different credit rating classes. This hyperplane is positioned to maximize the margin, the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points of each class.

Kernel Trick:

    SVM introduces the concept of a "kernel" to transform the input data into a higher-dimensional space. This transformation allows the algorithm to discover more complex decision boundaries. Common kernel functions include linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF) kernels.

## Advantages

1. SVM is particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces, making it well-suited for scenarios involving multiple financial indicators, as is the case in corporate credit rating forecasting.

2. Handling Imbalance:

    Given the imbalanced nature of the credit rating dataset, SVM's ability to handle imbalanced class distribution is valuable. SVM can be tuned to give more importance to minority classes, mitigating biases that may arise due to the imbalance.
